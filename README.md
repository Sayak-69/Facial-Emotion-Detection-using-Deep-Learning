# Facial-Emotion-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

# Project Overview
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of an Emotional Face Detection system implemented using deep learning techniques. The project aims to classify human facial expressions
into seven basic emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. The
system leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to achieve high
accuracy in emotion recognition from facial images.
Facial emotion recognition has become increasingly important in various applications such
as human-computer interaction, psychological research, marketing analysis, and security
systems. The ability to automatically detect and interpret human emotions from facial
expressions can provide valuable insights in these domains.

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
• To develop a robust deep learning model for facial emotion recognition
• To analyze and preprocess the FER2013 dataset for optimal model performance
• To implement transfer learning using pre-trained CNN architectures
• To evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
• To compare different approaches and identify the most effective solution
